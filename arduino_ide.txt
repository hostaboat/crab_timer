Since I'm using the Arduino IDE with Teensyduino to compile and push code to the
Teensy 3.2, the ATtiny13A directory can't be present since it has a .c file that
Arduino will want to include in the compilation but won't compile since it's for
a different target MCU.

So when cloning for use with the Arduino environment, have to exclude the
ATtiny13A directory.  Internet searches usually to pointed to the following
which seems to work.

$ cd ~/Documents/Arduino
$ mkdir crab_timer
$ cd crab_timer
$ git init
$ git remote add -f crab_timer file:///Volumes/PP2/code/crab_timer.git
$ git config core.sparseCheckout true
$ vim .git/info/sparse-checkout

Add the following lines:
/*
!ATtiny13A

$ git pull file:///Volumes/PP2/code/crab_timer.git
